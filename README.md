# Twitter-Analysis-SafariRally
<p> The goal of this project is to glean information about the Safari Rally from tweets. I scraped some data from Twitter and used it for analysis to generate some insights. Python libraries allow us to scrape data from Twitter.
</p>
<p> The libraries used included </p>
<ul>
<li>snscrape # For scraping data
<li>pandas # For basic data manipulation and recording the data as a csv file
</ul>
<p>Problem Statement </p>
<p> This section focuses on the research questions we want to answer or the insights we want to gain. This analysis addresses the following research questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which Twitter users sent the most tweets about the Safari Rally?
<li> On which days did the user tweet the most?
<li> When did the most tweets about the Safari Rally appear?
<li> What countries were the tweets about the Safari rally coming from?
<li> What user's tweet received the most retweets?
</ul>
<p> We can use visualizations to do some exploration to find insights from the tweets. Using interactive dashboards can help us fine-tune our data to our liking, allowing us to generate a plethora of new insights. You could use the day of the week in the dashboard I created to find additional data insights.</p>
<p> For example, if you want to know which user tweeted the most on Wednesday, the dashboard will sort the users by who tweeted the most on Wednesday, and this filter will affect other plots to only show the variations on Wednesday.</p>
<p> Here's the dashboard </p>
