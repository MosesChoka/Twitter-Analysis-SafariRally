# Twitter-Analysis-SafariRally
<p> This project aims at finding insight on the Safari Rally event from tweets. In order to generate some insights, I scraped some data from Twitter and used them for analysis. Python has libraries that enable us to scrape data from twitter.
</p>
<p> The libraries used included </p>
<ul>
<li>snscrape # For scraping data
<li>pandas # For basic data manipulation and recording the data as a csv file
</ul>
<p>Problem Statement </p>
<p> This section highlights the research questions we want to adress or the insights we would like to obtain. Some of the research questions adressed in this analysis include:</p>
<ul>
<li> Which tweeter users tweeted the most tweets regarding Safari Rally?
<li> On which particular days did user tweet more often?
<li> On which date was there a high number of tweets about Safari Rally?
<li> From which countries were the Safari rally tweets coming from?
<li> Which users' tweet had the most retweets?
</ul>
<p> In order to find insights from the tweets, we can do some exploration using visualizations. Using interactive dashboards can help us futher finetune our data to our liking 
so we could generate a lot other insights. In the dashboard I created, you could use day of the week to find other insights on the data.</p>
<p> For instance you would like to know which user tweeted the most tweet on Wednesday, the dashboard will filter out the users in order of who made many tweets on Wednesday
, in addition this filter affects other plots to show the variations on Wednesday only. </p>
<p> Here's the dashboard </p>
